## Launch Day Ceremony Script

### Opening Remarks (8:00 AM)

> "Good morning, and welcome to Wisdom Works Academy. My name is [Your Name], and I am honored to be your guide on this 4-year journey from apprentice to licensed General Contractor.
> 
> Today is not just the first day of a program. It is the first day of the rest of your life. You are here because you made a choice—a choice to invest in yourself, to build a future, and to join a community of builders who believe in integrity, hard work, and excellence.
> 
> Over the next four years, you will master the trades. You will earn while you learn. You will clock the 48 months of journey-level experience required by the State of California. And at the end, I will personally sign your experience affidavit—your golden ticket to the CSLB exam.
> 
> But before we begin, there is one document that binds us all together. It is not a contract. It is not a rule book. It is a code—a code of honor."

### Honor Code Signing (8:30 AM)

> "The Wisdom Works Honor Code is our foundation. It is what separates us from the contractors who cut corners, who cheat clients, and who give this industry a bad name.
> 
> When you sign this document, you are committing to five principles: Professionalism over Profit, Respect for the Craft & Code, the Alumni Shield, Absolute Financial Honesty, and Safety as a Duty.
> 
> These are not just words. They are promises. And violations of these promises have consequences—up to and including dismissal from this Academy.
> 
> If you are ready to make this commitment, please step forward and sign."

[Students sign Honor Code one by one, instructor shakes each student's hand]

### Closing Remarks (4:00 PM)

> "You did it. Day 1 is complete. You signed the Honor Code. You submitted your HIS applications. You learned the basics of Cal/OSHA safety.
> 
> Tomorrow, you begin the real work. But tonight, I want you to go home and tell someone you love: 'I started building my future today.'
> 
> Welcome to Wisdom Works. Let's build."
