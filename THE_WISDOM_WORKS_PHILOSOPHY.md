# The Wisdom Works Philosophy

> **"We don't just teach people how to swing a hammer; we train them to build a business."**

---

## About Us

It's been a massive download of technical and legal "bricks" to build this school. But if we take a step back and look at it organically, **the goal is simple**:

**You are taking a person who is willing to work and giving them a map to become their own boss.**

---

## Our Mission

At Wisdom Works, we don't just teach people how to swing a hammer; **we train them to build a business**. 

We believe that a strong work ethic is the most valuable tool in any toolbox, but even the hardest worker needs a map to navigate the legal and financial maze of California contracting.

## Who We Help

### We Are For The "Grinders"

We help the people who are **already on the job sites** but are tired of being the last to get paid.

We help the students who want to **"earn while they learn"** and the veterans who are ready to transition from being an employee to being an owner.

### Our Students Are:

- **The Helper** who's been at it for 5 years but still can't get anyone to sign their experience
- **The Career Changer** who's tired of retail/office work and wants tangible skills
- **The Veteran** transitioning to civilian life and looking for stable, hands-on work
- **The Ambitious 22-Year-Old** who sees their friends drowning in college debt
- **The Single Parent** who needs a real path to financial independence
- **The Immigrant** who knows how to work hard but doesn't know how to navigate the system

### What They All Have in Common:

✅ **Willing to work**  
✅ **Want to be their own boss**  
✅ **Don't have $30k for traditional trade school**  
✅ **Ready to commit 4 years to transform their life**  
✅ **Value integrity and quality craftsmanship**

## Why "Wisdom" Works

Success in this industry isn't about being the **strongest** person on the site; it's about being the **savviest**.

We provide the **"Wisdom"** (the legal loopholes, the contract strategies, and the 4-year licensing roadmap) so that your **"Work"** actually builds wealth for your family, not just your boss.

### The Wisdom Advantage:

- **Legal Protection**: Stop Work Notices, Lien Rights, Material Delivery Clauses
- **Financial Strategy**: HIS commissions, handyman opportunities, material delivery payments
- **Code Mastery**: California Building Code, Cal/OSHA 2025/2026, B&P § 7159
- **Business Acumen**: Estimating, contracts, project management, CSLB exam prep
- **Ethical Foundation**: The Honor Code that protects your reputation and your license

## The Organic Growth Plan (The First 90 Days)

You don't need 100 students to start. You need **2 or 3 of the right people**.

### Month 1: The Inner Circle

**Goal**: Identify the 2 or 3 people you already know who have the "grind."

**What to Say**:
> "Hey, I'm starting something. It's a school to help guys like you get your contractor's license the right way. I'll show you how to earn commissions now so you can own the company later. You interested?"

**Who to Target**:
- Your current helper/laborer (if you have one)
- A friend who's stuck in construction with no path forward
- Someone you see hustling on job sites
- A veteran from your network
- That kid who's always asking questions and wants to learn

**What Happens**:
- Coffee/lunch meeting
- Show them the 4-year roadmap
- Explain the HIS model: "You'll start earning commissions in Month 1"
- Have them sign the Honor Code
- Submit their enrollment agreement

### Month 2: The HIS Bridge

**Goal**: Get those first 2 people registered as HIS under your license.

**What to Do**:
1. Submit HIS applications to CSLB (2-4 weeks processing)
2. While waiting, train them on:
   - How to talk to homeowners
   - How to measure a job
   - How to draft a contract
   - Safety basics
3. **Let them see the money hit their pocket** from a deal they helped close

**First Commission Check**:
This is **the moment**. When they get that first $500-$2,000 commission check, they understand the model. They're no longer skeptical. They're believers.

**What to Say**:
> "That check? That's from selling a job, not swinging a hammer. Imagine doing this for 4 years and then owning your own license at the end."

### Month 3: The Work Log

**Goal**: Start their official 4-year clock.

**What to Do**:
1. Show them the Work Experience Log system
2. Explain: "Every Friday, you upload 3 photos and your hours. This is your golden ticket to the CSLB."
3. Take them to a job site and let them see their "hourly wage" turning into "licensing experience"
4. First milestone review (end of Quarter 1)

**What to Say**:
> "This logbook isn't just paperwork. In 48 months, I'm going to sign an affidavit that you've done journey-level work. The CSLB will take that to the bank. But only if you document it now."

## How to Talk About Wisdom Works (Elevator Pitch)

### 30-Second Version:
> "I run Wisdom Works Academy. We help construction workers get their California Contractor's License in 4 years while they earn commissions. Total cost is under $2,500, and students start making money in Month 1. It's basically an apprenticeship where I guarantee the experience sign-off at the end."

### 2-Minute Version:
> "You know how most construction workers stay stuck as helpers because they can't get anyone to sign their CSLB experience? I created a school that solves that.
>
> We register students as Home Improvement Salespeople under my license. They earn commissions on jobs they sell while learning the trades. Over 4 years, they clock the 48 months of journey-level experience the CSLB requires. At the end, I sign their experience affidavit.
>
> Total cost is under $2,500—no student loans. And because they're earning commissions from Month 1, most students pay for it themselves.
>
> It's not for everyone. It's for the grinders who are tired of being employees and ready to own their own future."

### 5-Minute Version (For Potential Students):
> "Let me ask you something: How long have you been in construction? [Wait for answer]
>
> And do you have your contractor's license yet? [Usually: 'No']
>
> Yeah, because getting it is a nightmare. You need 4 years of 'journey-level experience,' but good luck finding someone to sign your affidavit.
>
> That's what I'm solving with Wisdom Works Academy.
>
> Here's how it works:
> - **Year 1**: I register you as an HIS under my license. You start selling contracts and earning 10% commissions. You're learning and earning at the same time.
> - **Year 2-3**: You master framing, electrical, plumbing—the big trades. Every hour you work goes into your logbook.
> - **Year 4**: I teach you the business side—contracts, liens, estimating—and prep you for the CSLB exam.
>
> At the end of 4 years, I personally sign your experience affidavit. You take the exam. You get your license.
>
> Total cost? $2,500. Most students earn that back in their first 2 months of commissions.
>
> The catch? You gotta be willing to work and commit to our Honor Code. No cutting corners. No shady stuff. You build quality work and you treat clients right.
>
> If you're that kind of person, I can give you the map to get out of the hourly grind and become your own boss.
>
> You interested?"

## Common Scenarios: How to Handle Real Situations

### Scenario 1: "I Don't Have $2,500 Right Now"

**Response**:
> "That's fine. The $2,500 is spread over 4 years. You don't pay it all upfront. Here's what we do: You pay a $500 enrollment fee to get started. That covers your first quarter of training and your HIS application.
>
> Once you close your first contract as an HIS, you'll earn that back. The rest of the tuition gets paid as you earn commissions. If you work hard, you'll never feel the cost because you're earning while you learn."

**Alternative (If they're really broke)**:
> "Tell you what. You pay the $500 enrollment fee, and I'll give you a list of 10 handyman jobs you can do this month to earn it back. Work under the $1,000 limit, stay legal, and use that money to fund your education. Sound fair?"

### Scenario 2: "How Do I Know You'll Actually Sign My Experience?"

**Response**:
> "Great question. That's exactly what makes Wisdom Works different from just working for a contractor who 'promises' to sign your affidavit.
>
> Here's my guarantee: If you complete all 4 years, submit your monthly work logs on time, pass your milestone reviews, and uphold the Honor Code, I will sign your CSLB experience affidavit. Period.
>
> In fact, it's in your enrollment agreement. If I don't sign it after you complete the program, you get a full refund. I'm legally obligated.
>
> Why would I do this? Because my reputation depends on graduating licensed contractors. If you succeed, I succeed. We're aligned."

### Scenario 3: A Student Isn't Working Out (Violations, Poor Performance)

#### Minor Issues (Late work logs, missed training):
**Approach**: Coaching conversation
> "Hey, I noticed you've missed the last two work log submissions. What's going on? You need to stay on top of this because the CSLB will audit these logs in 4 years. If there are gaps, they'll reject your application. Let's get you back on track."

**Action**:
- Set up weekly check-ins for 30 days
- Pair them with a more senior student
- Adjust their workload if they're overwhelmed

#### Major Issues (Safety violations, poor client interactions):
**Approach**: Formal warning
> "We need to have a serious conversation. [Explain the violation]. This violates our Honor Code, and it puts the school's reputation at risk. If this happens again, you'll be placed on probation. If it happens a third time, you'll be dismissed from the program and your HIS registration will be cancelled. Do you understand?"

**Action**:
- Written warning on file
- 30-day probation period
- Mandatory remedial training

#### Critical Issues (Fraud, theft, dangerous behavior):
**Approach**: Immediate dismissal
> "I have to let you go. [Explain the violation]. This is a violation of our Honor Code and it's grounds for immediate dismissal. Your HIS registration will be cancelled today, and you will not receive a CSLB experience affidavit from Wisdom Works. I'm sorry it didn't work out."

**Action**:
- Document everything
- Cancel HIS registration with CSLB
- Refund any prepaid tuition (pro-rated)
- Remove from all projects immediately

**Why This Matters**:
Your reputation is your most valuable asset. One bad student can cost you referrals, reviews, and future enrollments. It's better to cut ties early than let a problem student poison your school's brand.

### Scenario 4: "Can I Do This Part-Time? I Have Another Job"

**Response**:
> "Yes and no. The CSLB requires 4 years of 'full-time' experience, which means about 160 hours per month (40 hours/week). If you're working another job, you'll need to commit at least 20-25 hours per week to Wisdom Works projects.
>
> A lot of students do this in the beginning. They keep their day job and do handyman work on weekends or evenings until their HIS commissions start covering their bills. Then they transition to full-time.
>
> But let me be clear: If you're only giving me 5-10 hours a week, your 4-year timeline becomes a 6-8 year timeline. The CSLB counts hours, not calendar time.
>
> Can you commit to at least 20 hours per week?"

### Scenario 5: "I Failed the CSLB Exam. What Now?"

**Response**:
> "First, don't panic. About 30% of people fail the first time. Here's what we do:
>
> 1. **Review your exam results**: The CSLB tells you which sections you struggled with. We'll focus your re-study on those areas.
> 2. **Retake prep course**: I'm giving you free access to our Year 4 exam prep for another 90 days.
> 3. **Practice exams**: You need to be scoring 80%+ on practice tests before you retake the real thing.
> 4. **Retake when ready**: No rush. Take the exam again when you're confident.
>
> You've already done the hard part—the 4 years of experience. The exam is just a test. You'll pass it."

### Scenario 6: "A Client Is Asking for Work That Requires Pulling a Permit. Can I Do It as a Handyman?"

**Response**:
> "No. Absolutely not. If a project requires a building permit, you cannot do it under the handyman exemption. Period.
>
> Here's what you do instead: Refer the client to me (the school). I'll handle the permit-required work under my license, and you'll work as my assistant on that job. You'll still log the hours, but it goes through the school's license.
>
> Never, ever tell a client to 'skip the permit.' That's how you lose your chance at a license before you even have one."

### Scenario 7: "Can I Use My Wisdom Works Training to Work for Another Contractor?"

**Response**:
> "Absolutely. In fact, I encourage it. If you get an opportunity to work for another GC and gain additional experience, take it. Just make sure:
>
> 1. You're still submitting your monthly work logs to Wisdom Works
> 2. You're documenting those hours for your CSLB application
> 3. You're not violating any non-compete (you don't have one with me)
> 4. You're upholding the Honor Code wherever you work
>
> At the end of the 4 years, if you want me to sign your affidavit, I need to have seen consistent work logs and milestone check-ins. If you disappear for 2 years, I can't vouch for your experience."

## The Organic Conversation: Talking to Your First Student

### Setting: Coffee Shop, Lunch Break, Job Site

**You**: Hey, can I run something by you?

**Them**: Sure, what's up?

**You**: You know how you've been talking about getting your contractor's license?

**Them**: Yeah, but I don't know where to start. It's like 4 years of experience or something, right?

**You**: Exactly. 48 months. And the problem is, most guys spend 10 years hoping someone will sign their affidavit. I got tired of watching good workers stay stuck, so I'm starting a school.

**Them**: A school? Like a trade school?

**You**: Kind of. It's a 4-year program where you learn the trades AND earn money at the same time. I register you as a salesperson under my license. You start closing contracts and earning commissions. Meanwhile, I'm documenting your hours for the CSLB.

**Them**: Wait, so I get paid while I'm learning?

**You**: Exactly. Most trade schools charge $30k and you're broke for 2 years. My way, you're under $2,500 total and you're earning commissions from Month 1.

**Them**: What's the catch?

**You**: The catch is it's 4 years. You gotta commit. And you gotta do it the right way—no shortcuts, no shady stuff. We have a Honor Code. But if you stick with it, I personally sign your experience affidavit at the end.

**Them**: So I'd actually get my license?

**You**: That's the whole point. You show up, you do the work, you log the hours, and in 4 years, you walk away with a CSLB-approved experience affidavit. Then you take the exam and you're licensed.

**Them**: Damn. That's... yeah, I'm interested. When do we start?

**You**: How about next Monday? I'll show you the roadmap.

## The "Why Now?" Conversation (Handling Hesitation)

### If They Say: "I need to think about it."

**Response**:
> "Absolutely. This is a 4-year commitment. You should think about it. But let me ask you something: Where do you want to be in 4 years?
>
> Because those 4 years are going to pass whether you're working toward something or not. You can spend the next 4 years as a helper making $25/hour, hoping someone signs your affidavit. Or you can spend it with a clear roadmap, earning commissions, and walking out with a guaranteed signature.
>
> Take your time. But the founding class starts [DATE]. After that, the next cohort isn't until [NEXT DATE]."

### If They Say: "I'm too old. I'm 35."

**Response**:
> "Too old? Man, you're perfect. You're mature, you've seen some life, and you know how to work. I've got a 22-year-old who's raw talent but doesn't know how to talk to clients yet. You? You'd crush it.
>
> In 4 years, you'll be 39. Would you rather be 39 with a contractor's license, or 39 still wishing you had one?"

### If They Say: "I don't have any construction experience."

**Response**:
> "That's fine. Year 1 is built for beginners. We start with safety, tools, and basic skills. By Year 2, you'll be ready for real projects.
>
> The question isn't whether you have experience now. It's whether you're willing to learn and put in the work."
