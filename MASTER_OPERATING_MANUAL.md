### The Exemption Disclaimer

*"Wisdom Works Academy is exempt from the California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 2009 under CEC § 94874(f). This institution is not approved by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education. Our total charges per student are $2,500 or less, and we do not accept state or federal financial aid."*

## 3. The "Loophole" Protection Toolkit

### The Stop Work Shield (Civil Code § 8830)

Use this if an owner stops paying. It kills the "Abandonment" charge.

**Step 1: Post the 5-Day Notice of Intent**
```
NOTICE OF INTENT TO SERVE STOP WORK NOTICE

TO: [Owner Name]
PROJECT: [Project Address]

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that Contractor intends to serve a Stop Work Notice 
pursuant to California Civil Code § 8830 if payment in the amount of $[Amount] 
is not received within FIVE (5) days from the date of posting this notice.

Date Posted: [Date]
Contractor: [Name]
License #: [License Number]
```

**Step 2: Serve the 10-Day Stop Work Notice**

If payment not received, serve via **Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested**.

### The Lien Killer (Notice of Completion)

Recording this within 15 days of finishing "kills" the danger window.

- Shrinks GC lien rights to **60 days** (from 90)
- Shrinks Subcontractor lien rights to **30 days** (from 90)

### The "Paper GC" Contract (B&P § 7159)

Ensure every contract includes:

1. **$1,000/10% Down Payment Cap** (12-point bold type)
2. **Progress Payment Clause** (required statutory text)
3. **3-Day Right to Cancel** (5 days for seniors 65+, 7 days for disaster repair)
4. **Mechanics Lien Warning** (exact CSLB statutory language)
5. **Full & Unconditional Lien Release Clause**
6. **Change Order Clause** (written and signed)
7. **CGL Disclosure Statement**
8. **Workers' Comp Disclosure** (mandatory for all by 2028)
9. **Start & Completion Dates** (approximate)
10. **Signed Copy Disclaimer** (12-point bold type)

### Material Delivery Payment Clause (B&P § 7159.5)

**The Strategy**: Bill for materials upon delivery, not installation.

```
SECTION: PAYMENT FOR MATERIALS DELIVERED

Pursuant to California Business and Professions Code § 7159.5, the Contractor 
may request and accept payment for materials and equipment once they have been 
delivered to the project site and are under the control of the Owner, even if 
such materials have not yet been incorporated into the work.

Upon delivery of significant materials (e.g., lumber, windows, cabinetry, or 
appliances), Contractor shall provide an invoice for the value of said materials. 
Owner agrees to pay such invoice within three (3) days of delivery.

Ownership and title to the materials shall pass to the Owner upon payment, and 
Contractor shall provide a corresponding "Unconditional Waiver and Release on 
Progress Payment" for the value of the materials received.
```

### Three Advanced "Pro-Tips"

1. **The "Proof of Delivery" Photo**: Take a photo the second the delivery truck leaves. Attach to invoice.

2. **The "Insurance" Pivot**: Tell homeowner: "Once paid for, you own them. Notify your insurance for coverage while in your garage."

3. **The "Joint Control" Trigger**: For large jobs ($50k+), use Joint Control Service. Homeowner puts money in escrow; escrow pays supplier and contractor directly.

3. **Month 2+**: HIS card approved, student begins selling contracts
4. **Commission**: Student earns % of gross profit on contracts they close

### Commission Structure

**Commission Rate**: 5-10% of Gross Profit

## 8. Financial Management & Payment Strategies

### The "Handyman" Start (AB 2622)

**Strategy**: Year 1 students can legally take on projects up to $1,000 without a CSLB license, provided no permit is required.

**Business Setup**:
- File a DBA (Doing Business As) for ~$100
- Obtain basic Handyman Liability Insurance
- Create business cards/flyers with required disclaimer

### Home Improvement Contract (HIC) Critical Clauses

See [Section 3](#3-the-loophole-protection-toolkit) for full list.

### Financial "Loophole Protection Knowledge"

#### 1. "Special Order" Protection (Direct-to-Vendor Payment)
For high-cost custom materials, have the homeowner pay the supplier directly to bypass the $1,000 down payment cap.

#### 2. "Joint Control" Exception (B&P Code § 7159.5(a)(8))
For large projects, use a CSLB-approved third-party escrow service. This removes down payment and progress payment restrictions.

#### 3. "2% Monthly Penalty" (Civil Code § 8800)
If an owner wrongfully withholds payment, they owe 2% monthly interest. Include this in contracts.

#### 4. "Right to Stop Work" (Civil Code § 8830–8848)
See [Section 3](#3-the-loophole-protection-toolkit) for complete process.

#### 5. Equipment "Mobilization" Milestone
Include a contract milestone for "Site Preparation & Equipment Mobilization" to get paid when equipment arrives.

### GC Project Kickoff Checklist (California 2025 Standards)

   - [ ] 2025 Fall Protection (6ft rule) staged
   - [ ] Lead Fit-Test Logs for workers (if disturbing paint)

## 10. The Wisdom Works Honor Code

### The Moral Foundation

The Honor Code is the "moral glue" that ensures your savvy students don't turn into the "shady contractors" the CSLB is constantly trying to catch. By signing this on **Day 1**, they commit to a standard of professionalism that protects the school's reputation and their own future license.

### The Honor Code

**"Integrity in the Build. Honor in the Contract."**

As a student of Wisdom Works Academy, I understand that a California Contractor's License is a privilege, not a right. I pledge to uphold the following standards of conduct:

#### 1. Professionalism over Profit

**The $1,000 Rule**: I will never knowingly accept a down payment exceeding 10% or $1,000, whichever is less. I recognize that "cash flow" never justifies a misdemeanor.

**Transparent Change Orders**: I will never perform extra work without a signed, written Change Order. I will not use "surprises" to inflate a project's cost.

#### 2. Respect for the Craft & Code

**No Cut Corners**: I will build to the California Building Code (CBC) or higher. I understand that a "hidden" mistake is a future failure.

**Permit Integrity**: I will never suggest a homeowner "skip the permit" to save time or money. I protect the property value and safety of my clients.

#### 3. The Alumni Shield

**Brotherhood/Sisterhood of Builders**: I will not undercut a fellow Wisdom Works graduate on a bid through deceptive pricing. We compete on quality, not by "racing to the bottom."

**No Poisoning the Well**: I will never speak ill of a competitor's work to a client. I will let my own craftsmanship and documentation speak for itself.

#### 4. Absolute Financial Honesty

**Trust Funds**: I recognize that progress payments are held in trust. I will pay my material suppliers and subcontractors promptly. I will never use "Job B" money to pay for "Job A" materials.

**The HIS Pledge**: As a registered Home Improvement Salesperson, I will never represent myself as a licensed contractor until the CSLB officially grants me my license number.

#### 5. Safety as a Duty

**The 6-Foot Stand**: I will not work at heights above 6 feet without proper fall protection, nor will I allow anyone under my supervision to do so. A life is worth more than a deadline.

### Student Acknowledgment

**"I understand that violating this Honor Code is grounds for immediate dismissal from Wisdom Works Academy and the termination of my HIS registration. I am building a legacy, and that build starts with my character."**

**Signature**: _________________________  
**Date**: _________________________

## 12. Marketing & Launch Strategy

### The "30-Day Launch" Social Media Strategy

To get your first class of savvy earners in the door, use this high-impact advertising and outreach strategy.

### Sample Ad Copy: "Earn While You Learn"

**Platform**: Facebook / Instagram  
**Headline**: **STOP WORKING FOR AN HOURLY WAGE. START BUILDING A LICENSED CAREER. 🛠️**

**Body**:
Are you tired of being the "helper" with no path to the top? In California, you need 4 years of experience to get your Contractor's License. Most people spend that time struggling.

At Wisdom Works Academy, we do it differently.

✅ **YEAR 1**: Get your HIS registration. Start earning 10% commissions on the projects you sell.  
✅ **YEAR 2 & 3**: Master the "Big 5" trades and clock your 48 months of journey-level hours.  
✅ **YEAR 4**: We prep you for the CSLB Exam and sign your experience affidavit.

We are an exempt vocational program (CEC § 94874(f)). Total tuition is capped at $2,500. Most of our students earn their tuition back in their first 30 days.

**Don't just swing a hammer. Own the hammer.**

**Call-to-Action**: Apply Now - Limited Spots Available

### Nextdoor / Community Groups

**Headline**: Local Trade School Helping Workers Get Their Contractor License 🏗️

**Body**:
I'm excited to announce Wisdom Works Academy, a new vocational program in [Your City] that's helping construction workers earn their California Contractor's License while they work.

If you know someone who:
- Works in construction but doesn't have a path to ownership
- Wants to become a licensed contractor
- Is tired of hourly wages with no future

Tell them about us. We're an exempt program (total cost under $2,500), and our students start earning commissions from Day 1 through our Home Improvement Salesperson program.

4 years from enrollment to license. No debt. Real skills. Real future.

### LinkedIn

**Headline**: California's Skilled Trade Shortage Has a Solution

**Body**:
The construction industry needs 30,000+ new licensed contractors by 2030. But the traditional path—4 years of "hoping someone will sign your experience affidavit"—leaves most workers stuck.

Wisdom Works Academy is changing that.

We've created a structured, CSLB-compliant 4-year program that:
• Provides documented journey-level experience
• Allows students to earn while they learn (HIS commissions)
• Stays under $2,500 (BPPE exempt)
• Guarantees a signed experience affidavit at graduation

If you're a GC looking to mentor the next generation, or a skilled worker ready to level up, let's connect.
