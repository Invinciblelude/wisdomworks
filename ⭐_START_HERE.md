## 💬 THE COFFEE SHOP SCRIPT (Copy/Paste)

**You**: "Can I buy you coffee? I want to run something by you."

**Them**: "Sure, what's up?"

**You**: "You know how you've been talking about getting your contractor's license? I started a school. It's called Wisdom Works Academy."

**Them**: "A school? Like a trade school?"

**You**: "Yeah, but different. It's 4 years. First year, I register you as a salesperson under my license. You start earning commissions on contracts you sell. While that's happening, you're learning the trades and logging hours."

**Them**: "So I get paid while I'm learning?"

**You**: "Exactly. By Year 3, your hours start counting toward the CSLB's 48-month requirement. At the end of Year 4, I sign your experience affidavit, you take the exam, and you're licensed."

**Them**: "How much does it cost?"

**You**: "Under $2,500 total. But you earn commissions from Month 1, so most students pay for it with what they make."

**Them**: "And you guarantee the signature?"

**You**: "It's in writing. You complete the 4 years, you get my signature. That's the whole point."

**Them**: "Damn. When do we start?"

**You**: "Next [DAY/DATE]. Let me show you the app."

**[Show them the 4-Year Roadmap screen]**

**Them**: "This is... yeah, I'm in."

**You**: "Cool. First thing we do is sign the Honor Code. It's our commitment to doing things the right way—no shortcuts, no shady stuff. Can you commit to that?"

**Them**: "Yeah, absolutely."

**You**: "Perfect. See you [LAUNCH DAY]."
